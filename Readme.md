white-seal.css is a lightweight, responsive and modern CSS framework based on [spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre) ([Demo](https://download.qutic.com/white-seal/)).

It is mainly used by the [RadiantMagic CMS](https://radiantmagic.com).

White-Seal supports Internet Explorer 10+, but some HTML5 and CSS3 features are not perfectly supported by Internet Explorer.
